==>ARDUINO UNO:
Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board developed by Arduino.cc which is an open-source electronics platform mainly based on AVR microcontroller Atmega328.
First Arduino project was started in Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in 2003 by David Cuartielles and Massimo Banzi with the intention of providing a cheap and flexible way to students and professional for controlling a number of devices in the real world.
The current version of Arduino Uno comes with USB interface, 6 analog input pins, 14 I/O digital ports that are used to connect with external electronic circuits. Out of 14 I/O ports, 6 pins can be used for PWM output.
It allows the designers to control and sense the external electronic devices in the real world.

==>BLUETOOTH MODULE HC-06:
HM-06 is a Bluetooth module designed for establishing short range wireless data communication between two microcontrollers or systems. 
The module works on Bluetooth 2.0 communication protocol and it can only act as a slave device. 
This is cheapest method for wireless data transmission and more flexible compared to other methods and it even can transmit files at speed up to 2.1Mb/s.
HC-06 uses frequency hopping spread spectrum technique (FHSS) to avoid interference with other devices and to have full duplex transmission. 
The device works on the frequency range from 2.402 GHz to 2.480GHz.
