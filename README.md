# Home-Automation
==>Home automation is a network of hardware, communication, and electronic interfaces that work to integrate everyday devices with one another via the Internet.
==>Each device has sensors and is connected through WiFi, so you can manage them from your smartphone or tablet whether you're at home, or miles away.
==>Home automation products can reduce power consumption and automatically turn off lights and appliances when they aren't in use.
==> Homes can be interfaced with sensors including motion sensors, light sensors and temperature sensors and provide automated toggling of devices based on conditions.
